# README-ISSUE

As of now, there are no type issues in the TRPC package.

PREVIOUSLY ... 
Was losing type safety in monorepo upgrading to v11 of TRPC. Possibly due to Biome or its extension?.

Even downgrading to 1.4.1 biome from 1.5.1, still no issue.

When installing packages, you have to restart VSCode in order for the types to show.
